[WORK IN PROGRESS]
This is a NextJS app created for my Dungeon and Dragons sessions, used to blog the summary of each session.
The app is integrated with Discord to deploy latest updates when submitting a new session

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
